                    This concert was recorded during the &quot;Dylan &amp; the Dead&quot; tour. On this brief tour, the Grateful Dead played two sets followed by a performance by Bob Dylan, with the Dead providing his accompaniment (some of those performances are documented on the album Dylan & the Dead).<br>

                    <p>Back in the early days of 1969, an up-and-coming band called The Grateful Dead were making waves along the West Coast. The band was generating some excitement, and CBS booked them to appear on a Hugh Hefner-hosted program called Playboy After Dark. Naturally, it being the Grateful Dead, things got totally out-of-hand, but everything wound up working out just fine.</p>

                    <p>The January 18th, 1969 performance has become something of a legend in recent years, especially after Bill Kreutzmann&apos;s telling of this story on Conan back in May 2015. As the legend goes, the Dead&apos;s sound engineer/LSD synthesizer Owsley &quot;Bear&quot; Stanley slipped some of his homemade psychedelic concoction into the Playboy After Dark crew&apos;s coffee supply, effectively dosing the entire staff for the late-night program.</p>

                    The March 29, 1990 Grateful Dead concert was the first of several to feature Branford Marsalis as a guest musician. In a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Marsalis recalled that Dead bassist Phil Lesh had invited him to play with the band for one song.
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>I came up for &quot;Bird Song&quot;, and after the set was over, I said, &quot;Thanks for letting me play, guys.&quot; And they&apos;re like, &quot;No, no, stay! Play the second half of the show. We&apos;ll do Dark Star.&quot; That had no significance to me. I&apos;m like, &quot;Dark Star? Okay. What is it?&quot; &quot;Oh, you&apos;re gonna love it. It&apos;s free, it&apos;s out.&quot; &quot;Great, I can play out.&quot; They start playing that lick, and the audience goes fucking bananas.</p>
                        
                        <p>Later, I started getting these phone calls on my private number: &quot;Man, you were great last night. Thanks for getting them to play Dark Star. They haven&apos;t played it in six months.&quot; I&apos;m like, &quot;Who are these people?&quot;...</p>
                        
                        <p>There was almost nothing [the Grateful Dead] couldn&apos;t play—and make the shit sound authentic. When they played a song by The Band or Bob Dylan, they played it with the same spirit as The Band or Dylan. They didn&apos;t feel the need to write their own arrangement of it. They were all listeners. There is a point where musicians who establish themselves stop listening to music and start listening to their own rhetoric. The Dead didn&apos;t do that. It was obvious in the way they approached a song.</p>

                <div class="videowrapper">
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuqeM-mbXeE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>The idea for the concerts had its origins in an Egyptian vacation taken by band manager Richard Loren. Following some on-the-ground research by Trist&apos;s close friend Jonathan Wallace and his meeting with Jehan Sadat, the then-First Lady of Egypt, Loren returned with bassist Phil Lesh and Alan Trist to meet with officials and begin the paperwork and logistics process. Through Wallace&apos;s introduction to Joe Malone, a professor at the American University of Beirut who was formerly with the State Department, the trio had made contacts with the Egyptian government. Describing the planning, bassist Phil Lesh said, &quot;It sort of became my project because I was one of the first people in the band who was on the trip of playing at places of power. You know, power that&apos;s been preserved from the ancient world. The pyramids are like the obvious number one choice because no matter what anyone thinks they might be, there is definitely some kind of mojo about the pyramids.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Rather than ship all of the required sound reinforcement equipment from the United States, the PA and a 24-track, mobile studio recording truck were borrowed from the Who, in the UK. The Dead crew set up their gear at the open-air theater on the east side of the Great Sphinx, for three nights of concerts. The final two, September 15 & 16, 1978, are excerpted for the album. The band referred to their stage set-up as &quot;The Gizah Sound and Light Theater&quot;.</p>

                    <p>The final night&apos;s performance concurred with a total lunar eclipse. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann played with a cast, having broken his wrist while horseback riding. The King&apos;s Chamber of the nearby Great Pyramid of Giza was rigged with a speaker and microphone in a failed attempt to live-mix acoustical echo. The guest musician was Hamza El Din, a Nubian oudist whose &quot;Ollin Arageed&quot; appears on the album. He was backed by the students of his Abu Simbel school and accompanied by the Grateful Dead. El Din also appears on the Grateful Dead album Road Trips Volume 1 Number 4.</p>
